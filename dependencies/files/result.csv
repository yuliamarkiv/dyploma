The back entrance he was brought in by paramedics was dirty, nurses were abrupt and were obviously tired and fed up and my partner was very distraught.  I went to the toilet which was disgusting piled high with dirty paper towel and a broken toilet seat on the floor.  This was literally yards from where doctors and nurses were working.  Could they not get a cleaner to do something. Ok they have a busy job to do but the smell emanating from those toilets surely would put more patients at risk from infections.  MRSA must be high in this hospital.  In the reception area just a little  further down there was a cleaner hoovering a spotless and empty reception. doesn't make sense.

163,"My elderly father was admitted via paramedic call out with an acute UTI. He waited in A&amp;E for about 6 hours before an Assessment bed was available. His current medication was wrongly recorded so for a week, in 3 different wards, he was given medication not prescribed for him.

My elderly family member currently in the hospital, was helped into the chair by the nurse and left with her buzzer acorss the other size of the room for over an hour.

Patients are not told enough information about their ilness - my family member was having constant D &amp; V and could not keep her food down, nobody has told her why she is constantly throwing up or monitoring anything she is eating. Instead they just put her on a drip instead of addressing the cause of the problem.

6147,"The A&amp;E reception area was dark and morbid. There seemed to be no separation for children and adults even after reporting to the reception desk. The two staff members at the desk looked gloomy and blunt (probably because they had a large fan operating behind them but they were dressed for winter).

We needed the Walk-in Centre, which features on the hospital's website as being open. On arrival (around 8:30pm), the centre was closed, with a note posted on the door directing everyone to the A&amp;E reception area; the note also mentioned that the A&amp;E reception staff will guide us to the Walk-in Centre, which apparently relocated within the main building.
A&amp;E reception staff said that the centre is closed and that it has not relocated and that everyone is being seen through the A&amp;E department.

They eventually took our details to see a pediatrician; one and a half hours later, we were still waiting to be seen.

Her temperature began to drop and her circulation was not good and she was placed on a kind of inflatable mattress that was so soft and a heated 'bear hugger' cover was put on top of her.  She was checked about every 30 minutes which was painful for her, but everyone was so kind and gentle with her, and spoke to her all the time even though she appeared to be completely out for the count.

Even though my son was very poorly and could not have cared less what was done to him, they usd to speak to him and tell him exactly what they were going to do and whatmedicines they were giving him. They also explained to us what they were doing. He had to go into intensive care for 1 night. They were also exccellent. My son is disabled so he needed a lot more care than normal, but te staff on ward 7 were out of this world. They would help change his bed, play with him, explain anything he did not understand etc. Also the doctors were great.

1884,"I also work within targets, and arrange appointments with people, but I never forget that people are not targets and it is them that actually matter.  

I understand that many women appreciate a quick appointment when finding a lump in the breast.  It is very frightening and stressful.  Quick, effecient diagnosis makes a big difference, so of course appointments should be offered as soon as possible.  I am happy to think that maybe someone who needed to be seen may have been seen quicker because I couldn't go at short notice.

However I do not accept that I should be punished because I would muck up the Consultants target.  Now I just have to hope it is not breast cancer instead of being able to find out for sure. Instead of being reassured by the Health Service I pay taxes for, I am stressed and scared.

I would like to convey my sincere thanks to the Eye Unit and especially Mr Butt who was extremely professional and thorough, genuinely personally concerned about my welfare. And Cathy, the HCA, who works very hard (and has to put up with some very difficult individuals, as I witnessed !)

6848,"An interested approach to questions posed by family members regarding progress with dad.
A better, respectful attitude to requests regarding the loss of denture bridge.It appears by offering a claims form that makes it acceptable to lose personal items. The logistics of getting my dad who has Parkinsons to a dentist are not realistic. It would be appreciated if the Nurses on duty could actually get up from the desk tops that they are sitting on at the Nursing Station and come to the front of the desk rather than  family having to shout their concerns across the area for all and sundry to hear.
A more responsible approach after finding medication not taken on dad's table. A nurse telling us she didn't know what it was, 'it wasn't on her shift'. Not reassuring at all.
I said that dad looked unclean and unkempt to the Deputy Ward Sister. I found him sat on the bed edge without his pyjama bottoms in a confused state. I was informed that dad was fine and I should 'see the state some patients are in at times'! He had faeces on his slippers and I commented that I should take them to wash and yet again was told 'We don't worry because we can't smell them, we only worry when we can! 
I have one positive comment to make and that is I rang to ask after dad and spoke to the Ward Clerk who went out of her way to inform me as full and as best she could to how he had been that day.

9900,"My mother has declined rapidly into dementia since January this year.  My sister and I have put out lives on hold to care for my mother and also for my father (both are 85) who is also very seriously ill.  It has not been easy and it is not a situation that I would choose but needs must and our parents had given us a beautiful childhood with little money and lots of love and this is our way to thank them.
My mother is very delicate and is often allergic to things.  On Monday 18th May she called to ca passer by from a window, she told her that we were keeping her there against her will and could she call the police.  The passer by called the police who then called an ambulance.  My mother told them that I was a terrorist and that I was not to be believed.  The ambulance staff said that they needed to take her to the hospital to get her checked over.  The police women said that it was obvious that mom was well cared for but that she was very angry with me and perhaps it was best to get her checked over and let her calm down.  I had sent my dad to his brother for a few hours so I was alone and I didnt know what to do.  I called my uncle who came and went to the hospital with my mom.  I couldnt go near her becuse she screemed at me.  

This was on Friday 22nd May.
My mother is now in Heartlands hospital having had surgery to repair a broken hip.  She broke her hip when she was allowed, dispite me telling them daily, to walk on a zimmer frame alone and she fell.  It was 14 hours before she was x-rayed and it took a phone call to my MP to get her from Solihull to Heartlands 4 DAYS later and for surgery the next day.  All this time my mother was in agony.  During the 14 hours she was undiagnosed she was taken out of bed 4 times and put on a comode.  My aunt had stayed with her from 14.00 until 19.00 and saw all that happend.

I was told last week that my mom probably wont walk again and therefore could not come back home because we could not care for her ""safely"".",Solihull Hospital,negative

12203,"My mother is currently being treated at this hospital.  The nurses and doctors do not provide us with any information and I feel that they have 'written my mother off'.  We were called early one Friday to say that my mother was fading fast, when we arrived we could not get onto the ward, when we eventually did, my mother was on a main ward with just a curtain around her.  She soon started coughing up blood, only then were we moved to a side ward.  She survived, since then my family and I have felt the need to stay with my mother as there is only one nurse per 12 patients.  My mother often pulls the oxygen mask off, we are on hand to put it back on.  The doctor and his team visit twice weekly but never do we receive any information from these visits, it took me three weeks to get the results from the CT scan.  My family and I are very upset by the way my mother has been treated, she is often left alone, only gets cleaned at around 0930 in the morning.

10136,"As a long term patient,at Southmead Hosp, speaking from my own personal experience I would no longer recommend this hospital for treatment as I have found that the standard of the overall heath care provided has declined noticeably in the past ten years due to internal hospital cut backs.

In my experience the hospital is poorly managed and consultants are regularly changed  without any prior discussion with the patient as to what they, the individual feels is the most suitable for their ongoing healthcare, and this appears to be mostly determined now by the various dept managers who make the decisions, and who on several occasions have proven to be very uncooperative when requiring answers to patient concerns..

I do not feel as if I am an individual, but yet another number on another file.- more of an inconvenience.

Waiting times for various apps and clinics are often lengthly and Norovirus outbreaks are a very regular occurrence at Southmead and this is something which must be considered when choosing this hospital particularly if one is elderly or immuno compromised.

I am severly needle phobic and had a massive panic attack when the midwife tried to do my bloods, they wandered out and the consultant came in. They were unfreindly, unsympathetic and very unprofessional. I felt guilty enough about not being able to have my bloods taken, when they came in there was no greeting but spent the next 5 minutes belittling me, giving me no support on the matter, made no attempt to make me feel calmer about the situation. They made me feel horrendous telling me all the stuff that could possibly be wrong or they couldnt spot, saying about needing my blood type incase things went horribly wrong or if i came in and needed an emergancy c-section and they wouldn't be able to do it. 

They never asked me how my pregnancy had been going, how i was managing with my previous back problems (still no word from the pain clinic 7 months into my pregnancy), how i felt in myself ect. I understand many ladies are pregnant and there is not always time to sit have a cuppa and chat but the basics on my pregnancy would be nice. 

After their rant at me, and i was back in floods of tears, they almost threw my notes at me, practically threw a box of, what i found out were, iron tablets they never explained anything about them to me and never told me what they were.

I had to give up to return to work without seeing her.The reason I was given for the delay is that &quot;the doctor is slow&quot; as an afterthought &quot;thorough&quot;. This doctor is given 10 minute appointments to work to and if more time is necessary for her to do a good then realistically more time should be allowed for each appointment.

The care my Dad is getting is NON-EXISTENT. 
 
He has not had a wash since he was admitted on Friday morning (29.1.10). He is such a clean man and likes to have a wash and the Nurses &quot;apparently&quot; asked him if he wanted a wash and (they said) he refused but we don't believe that for a second but even if he did refuse, they should still wash him. IT'S TOTAL NEGLECT. 
My Mum had to give him a wash herself, tonight (1.2.10) and when he brushed his teeth while sitting down in his wheelchair he spat out grey fluids. (DISGUSTING) He has not got any energy to manoeuvre himself and the Nurse's know this and yet they have been leaving him on his own while he has been on the toilet. Due to 
this, my Dad fell on Friday night and there were no Nurse's around to help him, as usual. 
 
He has bruises all over his wrist and arm and had blood in his fingernails. 
 
His T-Shirt has two times now had dry blood on it and it was left on him and so we, his family, had to change his pyjama top, underpants and pyjama bottoms. 
 
His bedding is soiled with urine because he cannot get to the toilet independently and also blood because they are not checking his dressings.

9557,"I was taken into Russells Hall Hospital in April 2009 after a serious fall at home. The A&E staff responded immediately and very thoroughly. Traction was applied to the wrist, and I was moved into X-Ray dept.
  In only a few minutes, the X-Ray staff attended me, and took the requisite X-Rays very promptly, and very considerately due to the intense pain i was suffering.
  Back to A&E, where the consultant advised me of the need for surgery on both injuries, including a hip replacement. Full and thorough discussion took place.
  I was then moved to WARD B2, where a bed had been prepared. THE STAFF IN THIS WARD WERE TRULY MAGNIFICENT - I really cannot praise them too much. From the Ward Manager, through all levels of nursing staff (even including the trainee and students), the were a really awesome team. Always attentive and responsive to my needs - always seper efficient - always enthusiastic and cheerful - they really made my stay quite memorable!
  The cleanliness of the Ward was fantastic. I made a point of watching the cleaner as she tackled the room - I was determined to find a small area she had missed - BUT I FAILED! She really did meet the standards of the rest of the team!
  Into surgery after a slight delay due to more serious cases being admitted for urgent surgery, where the anaesthetic and surgical teams were very helpfil, informative, and considerate. The operations were successfully completed.
  Post surgery, the Physiotherapy, and Occupational therapy teams soon got me on my feet, able to carry out washing and dressing tasks, teaching me to walk again, and determining my personal and domestin needs for my discharge from the Hospital. All staff were again truly superb, and I give profound thanks to EVERYONE associated wih my admission, treatment, and discharge.

OK we thought and took a seat in a very busy department. We saw the triage nurse about half an hour later who was very nice and courteous and gave my daughter pain killers and then we had to wait again. Nearly 3 hours later we saw a doctor who was really kind and considerate and treated my daughter with total respect. He sent her for an X-Ray and then he would have a better picture of what she had done. Once she had her x-Ray we waited another hour and then they explained she had broke a bone in her hand and need to see a specialist who was on his way. This doctor who again was polite and courteos explained exactly what the injury was and that she would need a pot on her hand and would then need to see a consultant. During this perod my daughter fainted and needed to go oxygen and the nurse was really thoughtful and caring to my daughters needs. The same nurse half an hour later put the pot on as gently as she could.

606,"I have just completed a course at the “Bedford Hospital Cardiac Recovery Programme”, better known as the “Bedford Heart Beat”.  This followed a successful aortic valve replacement carried out at Papworth Hospital in February.  I have nothing but praise for all aspects of the medical treatment I received, but wanted to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to the host and their dedicated team at the BHB.  The series of planned exercises, in the “Cardiac Circus” and all the useful following talks provided an excellent environment in which one could come to terms with the aftermath of major surgery.  A feeling of well being was, in my view, one of the main benefits.  This was not just a physical phenomena, but mental as well.  Being with others who had gone through similar traumas instilled confidence in ones ability to test out the capability of ones heart.  Also, the range of people who came, and very few dropped out, showed that the course was well designed to help all types of need.

I am well aware that the NHS is very much in the news, and with this new government we must wait to see what “efficiency” savings are demanded.  I would put the BHB into a safety net, under the sign “Do not tamper with” as, to me it is a natural follow on to the more specific “medical” treatments for cardiac patients.  Whilst it obviously has a cost implication, the fact that it is still going strong after fifteen years surely shows its value.

Therefore I request most strongly that when you and your team are faced with difficult decisions about the finance of Bedford Hospital, you see BHB as one of the best “value for money” and a natural addition to the Cardiac department.",Bedford Hospital South Wing,positive

5578,"To begin with my mother was admitted and we eventually found out she had terminal pancreatic cancer. The doctors informed us before we even found this out that she needed a stent to open the bottom of her stomach as the tumor had crushed it and she couldnt eat. this took them nearly 3 weeks to do and she died a few days later as by that time she was too weak to eat even if she had wanted to.

the staff were rude to her and one nurse in particular was extremely unproffesional, even making my mother cry at one point as the nurse shouted at her. my mother was 46 years old.

Following this, i started having severe abdominal pains when i ate. i went to a&e and due to what happened with my mother they rushed me through to see a ""doctor"" who didnt even examine me, discharging me with a water infection (even though the previous urine sample i gave had no trace of this)

my father demanded a second opinion as i was laying on the bed in agony. a second doctor examined me, gave me painkillers and admitted me straight away.
i got sent to the same ward as my mother was on just a few weeks before and not one of the staff looked at the records to see that my mother had passed away, therefore i had a at least one nurse every day asking how my mother was.
i was kept doped up oj whatever painkillers they could give me all day, leaving me alone just long enough that i was coherent when i had visitors, once they left it was more drugs. at one stage i rang the buzzer and it was still going over an hour later as noone had come to see me. i was told i needed to be put on a drip and that never happened.

At one stage I was on a ward with 3 other (elderly) ladies one of whom was a serial complainer - I think from visits to other people in hospital that this is not uncommon.  The problem was that the staff (who were well aware that she was a 'pain') could not address her behaviour - as professionals they looked after her the same as everyone else, but I did feel that her behaviour should have been adressed.  Not to do so is unfair on the other occupants of the ward who had to endure her constant groans and complaints.  They were poorly too and having a whiney neighbour was the last thing they needed.  I was very lucky to be transferred out again later on and so didn't have to put up with her for too long, had I had to I think that I would have spoken to her myself.

I do not remember the car park letter / number but as I approached it a security person (?) was directing traffic because it was full. As cars were leaving they were allowing vehicles in on a one-for-one basis and this meant a short queue. They beckoned me towards the car park and I waited. While waiting I checked for change to Pay and Display. To my annoyance I was a whole '10p' short. As a result I started to reverse off the car park entrance. The security person asked me what I was doing and I told them my 'small' problem. They told me to not worry about it and stay where I was. They directed another car away from the car park and returned to me and gave me '20p'. I thanked them very much and they joked about wanting my name and address. We laughed and I went about my business. This may not seem much but had they just ushered me away I would have had to leave the hospital grounds and had a long walk back. Thanks to them I parked, paid and visited my work colleague. My colleague was thrilled to see me and I told him the story and this made him laugh. This little gesture made my day.

I don't believe that the car park staff should provide security service, either.

197,"I agree with previous comments regarding the waiting time for blood tests. It seems inappropriate for retired/unemployed patients to take up valuable early-morning slots that could be used by people who work. Especially during the current economic climate, everything should be done to ensure that people in work are at work, and not sitting around in a waiting room. Surely it is not difficult to restrict the first hour to working patients. Other than that the service is fine.",Altrincham General Hospital,negative

I am 42 and went in as I had had an unsettling occurence the day before and to cut a long story short I spent about 9 hours in hospital. Without boring you I can say that:

All the staff were very well organised.
I was seen very quickly.
I was kept informed as to what was happening.
Numerous tests were undertaken (to be on the safe side), by different members of staff.
All the staff were very friendly.
I had privacy at all times.
The hospital was modern and very clean.

At the end of the day if you are poorly then this is the place you want to be at as these guys will look after you in a friendly and professional manner and do a good job.

7781,"I attended this out patients clinic with my mum.  We had an appointment at 3.05pm - the clinic was running late which was OK.  However, my mum was seen in a room with no door so we had constant noise outside in the corridor.  My mum is deaf and elderly so found it very hard to concentrate with all the hub bub.  Then, a female nurse wandered in to ask the nurse we were with whether he would cover her whilst she went on a tea break - no knocking, no waiting to see if she could interrupt.  Then an un-uniformed woman came in to say &quot;when you've finished with this one can you cover these&quot;.  My mother has a name or could at least be addressed as &quot;patient or client&quot; not &quot;this one!&quot;  The &quot;one&quot; who was doing her consultation at this stage was trying to get her blood pressure reading at the time and was interrupted.  At one stage there were 4 &quot;professionals&quot; in the room and only one was working with my mother.  Unacceptable. Could tell why there was a late funning of this clinic - too much chat and not enough work.  My son goes to a similar clinic in Ashford, Kent.  Doors on the room and no interruptions unless it's urgent (tea breaks and cover &quot;after this one&quot; is not urgent).

1505,"I write to you following the operation that you performed on my son Samuel Barton in March of this year 2010.  I am pleased to inform you that Sam continues to be pain free and is now slowly adjusting to a normal life as a young 23 year old with a future ahead of him.

It is difficult to articulate what this has meant to Sam and to us, his family.  For 12 years Sam has endured severe neuropathic pain secondary to a Congenital Vascular Malformation.  The impact of this on Sam cannot be understated, his young life disabled by constant untreatable pain.

The opportunity for pioneering surgery you offered earlier this year was a ray of hope.  Subsequently I wish to personally thank you for the outcome as Sam is now pain free for the first time in 12 years.  He now requires no analgesia and is thus free of the side effects of prolonged medication. 

The service that we received from your team was first class – and I copy this letter to the Chief Executives of your Trust requesting that this letter be sent to Ward Staff and Specialist Nurses.  The Trust should be deservedly proud of its staff and their international expertise.  All staff, Nurses, Specialist Pain Nurses, Doctors and Administrative staff were highly professional, approachable, kind and helpful.  The visitor’s accommodation that we accessed at the Hammersmith was comfortable and enabled my wife and I to be close by Sam during this anxious time despite the fact that we live in Swansea.   Your Secretary was outstanding, and her assistance made the entire process an easy one.

We are now adjusting to having Sam as an able-bodied son, as opposed to a disabled son – and for that my wife and I are grateful to all those who have supported Sam for the last decade, to all the Staff at Charing Cross, and we are particularly forever in your in your debt.

Who decides to send for you like this on a fools errand, I was at the hospital for 8.30 paid on the car park went to the clinic, put on a gown sat and read my paper only to come away again empty handed so to speak.  I thought it was very good of the nurse to offer to come in soon but she cant be doing that for everyone can she.  I dont know what the answer is to this but I rang admissions up to query why I was sent for today and she said it was what had always been done.

The staff were patient, caring and professional, even though overworked at times. The cleaning and hygiene regime was very strict on the wards where I was a patient. I don't usually make comments by email or otherwise. I was, however, moved to write this today in response to the &quot;Dr. Foster Report&quot; which I saw on the TV news.

Once more a full explanation as to what was to take place was explained by both the surgeon and anaesthetist. The entire recovery process on the ward was once more caring and professional by all involved. The infection control measures carried out by the staff were most apparent.

I genuinely appreciated the level of information provided and the opportunity to ask questions about any aspect of my treatment which the Doctors, to their credit, were able to express in terms easily understood.

127,"The only person involved in the entire process at A&E whose first language is English, was the ""NHS Direct"" nurse, and the receptionist in the A&E department, who seemingly was as frustrated as the patients.

I couldn't get an appointment at my doctor's for another two days, and as I had sustained a pretty severe head injury a couple of days before, and was suffering symptoms of brain trauma, I was very concerned so I called NHS Direct. After listing my symptoms, they advised me to go straight to A&E.

After registering with the receptionist, I was asked to attend triage, where I was dealt with by a member of staff - English was his second language. I explained that I had spoken to NHS Direct and they had advised me to come directly to A&E. 

I tried to explain what my symptoms were, which was quite a lengthy list, but he seemed to have trouble understanding, and made very little notes.

I was then asked to wait in the waiting room. Shortly afterwards, I was asked to go through to a cubicle to see the Doctor. On entering the cubicle, there was a very, very tired looking doctor, sprawled on a chair, and a student nurse. For both, English is their second language - and their primary language is different to that of the triage nurse.

This is where it became apparent that communication is a big issue in this department. The triage nurse's interpretation of my symptoms beared no resemblance to what I had told him, and so the Doctor made assumptions about my health based on his watered-down notes.

The Doctor then had trouble understanding my husband, who also uses English as his second language - but again, a different primary language to the triage nurse, doctor, and student nurse.

It was like a comedy of errors. The Doctor was not interested in listening to my symptoms, and dismissed me. She handed me a head injury advice sheet, which literally spelled out all of the symptoms I was having, which advises you to go straight to A&E.",Airedale General Hospital,positive

She showed me into a room were she quickly assessed me and then guided me through the final stages of labour. My daughter was born only a couple of hours later. The midwife never left my side and thanks to her the ""damage"" was minimal. Both me and my boyfriend would like to express our sincere thanks to her and the whole team. 

Unfortunately I then had to have surgery for a manual removal of the placenta. The procedure was fully explained to me and while this was done very swiftly, every member of the team took the time to introduce themselves and go through their role. Again I would like to express my thanks to every one involved.

A second GP referral took me to the Consultant’s clinic at QEII where I saw both his Registrar and himself. This, in contrast, was a wholly satisfactory experience. I was seen on time and treated courteously and very efficiently; things were explained clearly. I was impressed and hugely relieved. My husband accompanied me and feels the same as I do. We felt it was not ideal that the initial consultation was in a shared area but at the same time this increased effectiveness as the Registrar (sorry - have forgotten their name) was quickly able to share information with the Consultant.

519,"All things, but some need more urgent attention than others. Shortage of staff is probably the root of many issues.  Patients left too long and in pain on bedpans because staff are attending to other patients, no encouragement or help given to those unable to take fluids for hours on end, bedbound patients unable to call for assistance not checked regularly, meals left going cold on tables as no staff member available to assist.  The observation skills of nursing staff, perhaps because of the lack of time, is poor and crucial information is not passed to the doctors.  The doctors do not seem to speak with one another and do not read patient's notes adequately.    Relatives and carers visiting patients ask questions or make observations to nursing staff who often do not get back to them or suggest they make appointments with the doctors.  Very difficult for people who work.  Nursing notes not complete or inaccurate on occasions, potentially impacting on patient's care on discharge.

We can never thank the staff enough for all the care, compassion, respect, dignity and empathy shown by everyone to my father (mother and family) from the moment he brought by ambulance into the A & E. 

We would like to thank everyone in the A & E for everything they did for him before the porter and nurse took him to ward 6C. My father was moved to ward 6B when it became clear that he was not going to survive the bleed on his brain, which allowed our large family to say goodbye to him, support my mother and each other.

We hear so many negative things about the NHS and not enough about the excellent work performed by so many.  In my father’s case everyone from the porters, domestics, caterers, housekeeper, nurses and doctors played there part in the marvellous care of my father as if he and us, the family, were the most important people in their lives.

We would like to give a special thank you to the doctor who so kindly gave us the bad news on Saturday 29 May; and to the two nurses who helped and supported us during that dreadful night of 30/31 May and still cared for my father as if he were their own until he went gently to sleep.  

In addition, I and my mother would like to say thank you to the bereavement service and the registry officer for the help and support we received.

I made the comment to the Doctor and the nurse in the theatre that the lad was having a bad day, this was laughed off.

8285,"24.8.09 This afternoon I returned from the Royal Blackburn Hospital with my 17year old autistic son Alan. We were admitted to the Surgical Triage Unit on Wednesday afternoon as Alan had suspected appendicitis. He did indeed have a perforated appendix which was operated on that night and he was then admitted to ward C18. I wanted to say how much we appreciated the care we have received. Without my asking we were given a private en suite room, which I'm sure helped aid Alan's recovery, and meant that I could remain with him. It meant I didn't have to worry about Alan possibly disturbing other patients with his noise, or Alan himself being upset by other's noise. I must also tell you how kind and understanding everybody was. Although Alan is needle phobic, the doctor in the triage unit gained Alan's trust sufficiently that he allowed him to insert a cannela. The nursing staff were all lovely  on C18, and if I must single anyone out it would be nurse Simon Kilshaw, who had a lovely manner when talking to Alan. However, it was not just the medical team that impressed us. The ladies who kept us supplied with food and drinks, and the ladies who regularly appeared to clean and empty bins etc plus the man who came in to change the curtains, were all friendly and approachable so that stress levels were kept to a minimum. Although we are extremely happy to be home once again, I am immensely grateful that should we ever have to cross you threshold again, it will be with confidence and not with apprehension.

After trying to endure the pain for four weeks, I could take no more and decided to go back.  I saw a wonderful doctor who had all the time in the world for me and sent me for another x-ray.  He explained everything to me and that the pain was being caused by the bone healing awkwardly and my big toe catching everytime I walked so I am now in an air-cast.  I am now quite comfortable and find it difficult to understand why the first doctor couldn't have allowed me this treatment in the first place.

The patient has now deteriorated so badly that they are restricted to the upstairs of their house getting around mainly in a wheelchair/ They are also in contnuous pain taking painkillers every 4 hours,
They were meant to be given an outpatients appointment for 3 months time which was actually made for 6 months and then cancelled and delayed a further 4 months. PALS managed to get this reduced from 10 months to 4 months. The patient then contacted the Consultants secretary pleading with her and managed to get the appointment in 2 months. The thing is that the problem was identified on the MRI scan and the patient would now like to proceed with corrective surgery rather than going backwards and forwards to outpatients. This has been made clear by PALS to the Consultant.

Just the other day, my grandma was in tears because of the way she felt she was being treated, she sat in her chair from 6:30 am (which i find terrible to begin with,the idea of how early they seem to wake the patients up) until 1pm, which as you can imagine for an old women, that must have been very uncomfortable for her.Eventually, the day shift nurse came in and helped her into bed, if I'm honest i would go as far to say that the night shift nurse, who left her in her chair, was more concerned about finishing their shift, rather than ensuring the care and welfare of my grandma. 

Secondly, i find the quality of entertainement for the patients highly unsatisfying, they have one television in my grandmas ward, in the top corner where 50% of the ward cant see it. 

I'd also like to comment on the appearance of the hospital, I found my initial thoughts of the building, were very negative, in my opinion, it is very grim, and unpleasent.

6426,"1. The behaviour of some of the nursing staff. Particular individuals upset me because of their refusal to change sheets that, due to my condition, were soiled. The comment was &quot;do it yourself&quot;. How is one expected to respond to such a comment when one is ill and shivering with a high temperature and a rampant infection, and when one can barely get out of bed? 

There were other such incidents that I am too upset to re-count. I felt I could not complain because that would likely make their behaviour towards me worse and as someone who was severly ill and weakened, that would have caused me more stress.

Some two hours and dozens of dirty looks and sighs later, a doctor appeared with my presciption only to tell me that I would then have to go to my doctors the next day to get a full prescription as they only had enough for one day!

i was warmly greeted and shown to my room by a nurse, who gave me a step by step account of what would be happening next and who would be taking care of me etc.

This hospital is amazing and I was so pleased that all the disturbing stories I had previously heard were not true as far as I was concerned.

I was quietly and carefully listening to what he was saying and he kept repeating: ""Do you understand?"" (maybe implying that, as a foreigner, I could not understand). When I was trying to answer to his questions I was often interrupted. 

All this resulted in a waste of time and an anamnesis that did not elicit any more information than the amount I had made available to my GP. 

After the experience I think that no matter how knowledgeable a professional is in his/her own field, more care must be devoted to the exercise of interacting empathically with patients.

Ward manager is a very kind, caring compassionate woman, whom not only cares about the patients but her staff and the ward environment too.  The communal furnishings are homely and of a good quality; not what one would expect in a psyche hospital environment.

6518,"I accompanied a friend to the fracture clinic for a Monday morning appointment. We arrived at the time given, to join a queue waiting in front of a reception desk with its shutters closed. Being a fracture clinic many of the people queuing had difficulty standing or walking, and some were obviously in pain. Before long the queue went all the way to the door and then turned along inside the clinic. It then became difficult for new people arriving to see where to go to join the queue, and hard to actually get past other people to the end of the queue.  It was particularly difficult for people with large crutches or in wheelchairs to move around, and there was quite a risk of people bumping into each other. This caused anxiety for people including my friend trying to avoid further hurt to injuries, and there was a generally stressful atmosphere. Time in the queue was longer than the time the actual appointment took, so this was a significant part of the experience. 

There may have been a particular problem with the reception opening late on that day. But the was a bigger problem underlying this seems to be having a system that requires lots of people with damaged joints etc to come and stand in a queue. There must be a better way, such as a ticketing or a check-in system, perhaps combined with spreading out the starting time for appointments particularly at times like Monday mornings that are known to be busy.   I also wonder whether people are offered the chance to book appointment times if it is less urgent.

He was extremley poorly and was taken to ITU, I was at all times updated on his condition and the doctors and nurses made time to explain things I didn't understand. I found myself in an alien scenario and the people who work in the hospital, made me feel at ease with the situation I found myself in, they didn't just look after my husband but me aswell, and I wasn't even a patient. I was at the hospital at all hours of the day and night, and I can honestly say that I didn't see any part of the hospital that was dirty. We have since used the hospital many times, due to out-patient appointments etc. and found that the service we received was outstanding.

According to the information given by Department of Health (http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Entitlementsandcharges/OverseasVisitors/Browsable/DH_074381) and its implementing regulations (http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Entitlementsandcharges/OverseasVisitors/Browsable/DH_074381), my wife and I are entitled to have a free NHS service as patients because we are included in exemption for charges. However, they declined my wife, who is pregnant, because of our living in UK less than 12 months. 

If they could say ""NHS Hospital TRUST"", I believe they should trust the regulations and guideline of NHS. However, they do not allow an exemption case such as ours, an UK employee and less 12 months living.

Therefore, they advised us to pay £2,000 in advance or let my wife (35 weeks of pregnancy) go out and find other hospitals which may have less level of criteria, which means ""follwing NHS guideline"".

My son was taken into special care after he was born and because i am a larger women the nurses refused to help me out of bed and i didnt see my son for the first 2 days, special care was fantastic though. So when i fell pregnant late 2009 i was so worried about having my baby at milton keynes and was even thinking about going to another hospital, cause of my complications before my doctor suggested i have an elective c section but when i went to see the consultant she was adamant i went into natural  labour and she had me in tears by the time i left. I then went back for another appointment and this point i was adamant that i was having a c section and they finally agreed, the midwives in the clinic where fantastic and couldnt have done more for me. When i was taken into the ward it was clean and the staff where really nice and the consultants where great, they listened to my concerns regarding the epidural and they couldnt get it in my back last time and i was put under, so when i was taken down they tried to get it in for 45 mins and in the end i was put under, but the care after was far better then the last time i was there and the midwives couldnt have been more helpfull, even when i had trouble getting up they helped, i was suprised by the major change and it was good to see with my own eyes the changes they have made.",Milton Keynes Hospital,positive

4932,"Ward 8A - Problems with levels of patient care. I regulary visit a family friend in Ward 8A. I had been asked to drop something in recently and was shocked to observe the treatment of an elderly female patient. With a raised voice, a Sister was telling her 'to look at me when I am talking to you!' The Sister then grabbed the patients chart and stomped off. She talked and laughed about the patient to other staff in earshot of everyone.
On a different occasion, a male patient had beome agitated after expressing concerns about the care he was receiving. He started shouting and I was horrified to see the nurse shouting back at him, she continued shouting as she walked away and while completing tasks away from his bedside, escalating the situation.
Some of the day nurses would benefit from putting themselves in their patient's shoes and exercising a little more restraint , patience and professionalism. When any issues are raised the standard response is a defensive one - 'we are really busy you know' or similar. 
Patients are told off when they buzz for nurses too often and equally are told off if they haven't buzzed and things go wrong. People asked to see PALS for support, and nurses fobbed them off and did not contact PALS as requested.
Any patients who expressed dissatisfaction, were treated with contempt and left to fend for themselves. I had to help someone who had drinking water left out of reach and I got the feeling that no one wanted to complain for fear of the same type of treatment.
Night staff seemed more sympathetic, although they smoke on the ward.
PALS cannot really help, they feel they have to be neutral and the stalemate between some staff and patients continues until they are discharged.

7944,"My husband and I were referred to the Burton Centre for Reproductive Medicine due to fertility problems.  It took over 5 months from referral by my GP for tests to be performed diagnosing my husband's fertility problem and for a course of treatment to be determined.  I had a blood test for hormone levels but this test was performed at the wrong time of the month so was pointless.  When I asked whether they would be performing further tests on me I was advised that this would not be necessary because the treatment (ICSI) would be the same.  However, my husband and I have sought treatment elsewhere and I have had tests which have confirmed that I have a condition (hydrosalpinx) which means that, if I did get pregnant, I would have a very high chance of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.  I therefore need surgery before fertility treatment can start.  We only get one NHS funded cycle and I believe that, if we had continued our treatment at Burton, their failure to carry out tests on me would have rendered the treatment unsuccessful.

We were disappointed that we were misled about the chances of success at the Burton treatment centre.  The nurse quoted the national success rate rather than the treatment centre's success rate (which is less than the national average).  We were not informed that we had a choice of one of six treatment centres at any stage - we found this out for ourselves.  We actually had the choice of treatment at a centre which has double the success rate of Burton Hospital.  Finally, we found that the treatment centre was very inefficient.  For example, rather than give us forms to complete during one of our hospital appointments we had to wait several weeks for them to arrive by post.  I believe that the whole process is very protracted.  The number of stages is excessive as is the waiting time between every stage.  Surely these could be reduced, particularly as infertility is a time sensitive issue.

I was seen almost immediately by a nurse who introduced herself to me, smiled (which makes such a difference to patients) & explained what was going to happen to me - I have been to the same A/E Dept with the same condition several times so had a good idea of what would happen but was very reassured by the fact that she didn't assume that I would know what was going on & was prepared to offer explanations to me. A Sister walked past my trolley & also smiled. It was the middle of the night & they were incredibly busy, so they must have been very tired & can't have felt that they had much to smile about at that time of the morning, but the fact that they made the effort to do so was very much appreciated. The Department was very clean & seemed to be run in a very well organised manner. All the staff seemed to work well together & all the patients, including myself, were dealt with in a kind, calm, sensitive, professional & timely manner with compassion & occasional humour where appropriate & every member of staff that I saw either personally or who were attending to other patients behind curtains was polite & patient - one occupational therapist showed unbelievable patience with a presumably confused patient. The privacy & dignity of the patients was obviously very important to the staff too. The A/E doctor who saw me was polite and friendly in a professional way, introduced himself, explained his plan of care & then when he thought of a better plan came back & discussed & agreed it with me. I felt that he also listened to what I was telling him - which is not always the case with some doctors, unfortunately.

I felt so safe and secure in the care I was getting at all times even though it was my first baby. Once the baby was born I was given just enough space to figure things out for myself but also knew that help and advice wasn't far when I needed it. We were well informed throughout at each stage of the delivery process and afterwards.

I also had an MRI of my neck, which is not a particularly enjoyable experience if you don't like enclosed spaces, but again, the staff were great and on time.

When it came to my surgery, I was admitted in the Surgical Admissions lounge, which was exceptionally clean, and shown to my own 'cubicle'.  I did have to wait quite a while, but was kept informed of where I was on the list.  The Surgeon and the Anaesthetist made me feel very safe and relaxed, as did the nurse who sat with me in recovery.  As soon as I was moved onto the Laverstock ward, they informed my partner so that he could join me.  I was very lucky in that I had a room to myself off the main ward, which meant I had an uninterupted night's sleep. In the morning, the staff attending to me were very prompt in fixing me up, which meant that I was discharged at 10.00am on the dot.

9355,"Nothing, 3 members of my family were admitted within days of each other all with pneumonia and pleurisy they were placed at different ends of the hospital so visiting was very difficult. That aside, the treatment of my younger sister who is only 30 years old was horrendous. When I visited her  she was always in tears threatening to leave in a taxi because she was not recieving the pain relief (Morphine) that she should be getting with 12 hours regularly passing before she was given any relief. She was regularly sick and it would take 1 - 2 hours before they would clean it up and often bring her her meal with sick surrounding her, they would place her food where she couldn't reach it and there was never any water for her to drink and all she wanted when i visited her was to brush her teeth and feel comfortable but due to the pain she couldn't move. when I, as a visitor approached the nurses i was told they were busy at the moment.  When finally a Nurse assistent came over she said &quot; You should have told me that you needed pain relief to which my sister replied i did but people would come then say i will see what i can do and then never return, or they would never respond.&quot; My sister struggled to talk due to the pain and therefore i tried to get her some help it was only when i refused to leave until she received pain relief that they finally got it for her only after they found the controlled drug keys and a witness to over see the dispensing which took a further half hour. I am also a nurse but i found visiting my sister the most distressful thing i have ever experienced. Staff  ignoring patients, It made me cry to see my sister suffer in such a way. One one occasion she was begging for pain relief and her antibiotics as it had been nearly 36 hour since she had received her treatments. the nurse said your coughing because you have seen the physio. she had not seen the physio, her response when told this was Oh so you are coughing for real. she was coughing up blood",Royal Shrewsbury Hospital,positive

6679,"I have experienced treatment at Derriford hospital here in Plymouth in the past and was amazed at the difference between the two. At Peninsula I was treated as a person in every department by all members of staff, which was  very pleasing and relaxing in contrast to the NHS number treatment of Derriford. I can well imagine this being a very reassuring feeling for patients who are apprehensive. Everything revolves around the patient (and their family) who is made to feel that they are the only one that matters, which is very relaxing. From the moment you step through the main entrance you are aware of how clean the hospital is and this is continued through the whole building. This is probably why an outbreak the likes of MRSA etc.has not been reported in the news unlike at many hospitals. From first contact you are engaged in conversation about your reason for being there and everything is explained in easy terms, so that you know exactly what will be done when you are admitted for treatment. At every stage of your treatment everyone attending to you introduces themselves and explaines their role, asks if you have questions or concerns and gives answers and/or reassurance. My experience was made even more relaxed because all the staff were relaxed and cheerful; I even shared a joke with the anesthetist just before entering theatre!

 I attended the Day Surgery Unit on 3rd November 2010. 
The first person to greet me was the receptionist. She was excellent. Everything was relayed to me in a kind, clear and concise manner.
 I then met the anaesthetist who was very kind and listened intently to my answers to his questions. I felt immediately at ease knowing that he was responsible for my health and well being whilst being anaesthetized. 
I then met the nurses and staff nurse. They were very thorough in all the tests and were extremely polite, pleasant and professional. I had my (obs) taken, pulse, temp, blood pressure and blood sugars every 15 - 30 minutes. (There were around twenty of us there for operations that morning). 
I then met the consultant and his registrar and they were excellent. They asked me questions and explained what would happen during the procedure. I asked some questions which were answered honestly and reassuringly.There was an initial wait before I went down to theatre but then I was taken down and was left in the prep room. The two nurses there were kind, reassuring and excellent. We chatted whilst I was connected to the heart monitor and a cannula was put in. The nurse was confident and professional. I didn't feel a thing.The anaesthetist came in then and sent me to sleep talking to me all the time and I felt calm and placid. I awoke in the ward and i was looked after by another kind, considerate and professional nurse. The care that I received was excellent. They continued to check my obs every 15 - 30 mins and I was really thankful. They dealt with a lot of patients hat morning and it all ran really smoothly.

436,"The website states:-
"" Patient meals  -  For patients staying overnight and longer, we provide a wide range of catering services to suit your needs.  Our menus have been designed to offer a selection of nutritional meals which cater for all dietary needs.  Mealtimes on the wards are protected which means all non-urgent clinical tasks stop for a period of time so that patients can eat their meals in peace, with support if they need it, without being interrupted""
If you are a vegetarian which is a personal choice and not life threatening, you are catered for. But, if you are a Coelliac which is not a personal choice but a life long affliction and requires you not to eat anything containing gluten, there are no options on the menu. 
The local ward staff did their best but the hospital kitchens were unable to help.
So why do people who do not have to not eat meat get a choice but people who's life will be threatened if they eat anything containing gluten have no choices?
It is very easy to make pastry or gravy or cheese sauce etc.. using gluten free flour which tastes the same but can be eaten by everybody. If this were done, then the words quoted earlier from the website would then ring true.",Barnsley Hospital,negative

I felt very apprehensive as I had heard so many tales about hospitals in UK and besides we were due to fly back home in two days'. I needn't have worried; he was seen to straight away not even five minutes' wait from registration. All the doctors, nurses etc on that particular morning at emergency section showed nothing but sheer caring and utmost dedication.
My husband was hospitalized for 6 days in Reckits ward, and all the staff in the ward were absolutely marvellous. They were there when my son and I panicked and wanted to know more. Our special thanks to the house doctor, so down to earth and helpful, and to the wonderful staff nurse who was so caring and thoughtful, managing to relieve us of our fears and worries, and last but not the least to the ward's chest nurse who was also so very helpful and dedicated. 
I have been singing New Whittington's praises ever since. We have a state-of-the-art, newly built hospital in my country, however, it just shows you that it is that little bit of extra effort showing how really caring staff are, that really matters.

It was obvious that the staff enjoyed working together and communicated with each other and patients in a friendly, curteous and efficient manner. Paperwork and red tape was done routinely and very efficiently.  The staff had a sense of purpose with a personal touch. They were informative and considerate but actually LISTENED ! Answering what maght seen silly questions with patience and appropriate reassurance.  They made me feel like an individual whose needs were important to them. I was a welcome visitor... not a number!  Everyone who I came into contact with knew my name.  How refreshing!  There was a reassuring sense of teamwork...I saw the same nurse ...and saw the same senior nurse...and met with the surgeon prior to the opp.  Minimum of fuss and minimum time wasting.    The admittance procedure was so reassuring too!  Routine MRSA screening...I was in good hands !  Tea and coffee facilities(real crockery) and complementary newspapers in the waiting room...the little touches make all the difference!  Private bedrooms, en suite bathroom, crisp linen, self controlled heater, nurses on call with a smile ...I thought I was in a health spa having a treatment!  The opp theatre was high tech but the theatre staff so put me at my ease I forgot where I was!  I went asleep mad sentence....woke up feeling simply great !   How's that for stress free!  Not even bruised where the needle went into the back of my hand !  Back to my room, and a pot of tea and access to pain killers when required !  Another pot of tea with my home made sandwich(and one for my chaperone).

Especially at 19 I was nervous about what would happen whether theyd take me seriously, and whether they would be willing to help me. My first consultation with the gynaecologist went well, I didn't feel patronised, and they explained to me about a condition I may have. They said they didn't want me to have a laparoscopy when we could try different treatments, while staying optimistic it could just be hormones at my age. I left with another appointment booked. 3 months later I went back and told my gynaecologist it hadn't worked I was still suffering, within minutes we was filling out a consent form for a laparoscopy. Also the same day I had my pre-assessment and had a date set. The nurses were all very friendly and helpful. The anesthetist was also very friendly when I met them, they was helpful and explained in detail what they were going to do and answered all my questions. They talked me through what was happening. They was really helpful and made me feel comfortable. The recovery nurses were also helpful as I came round, the nurse stayed by my side checking evrything was fine, asking me how the pain was and relieving the pain slowly so they didn't give me too much, they also gave me a stick with a wet sponge to moisten my mouth with.

I was on the plastics ward but we had a lady with chest problems and an elderly lady that took up quite a bit of the nurses time instead of them just being able to concentrate on plastics. I dont think this could be improved really though as everyone reacts differently to treatment so you can never tell how long people will be staying in hospitals and the amount of traumas that come in just cant be helped.

4695,"in shorthand. here is a bulleted list of areas of extreame concern.

* professionalism and manners of staff were disgusting. No bedside manner. No warm caring atmosphere.

* tension regarding short staff and uncapable staff. leading to myself and other patients not getting medication, pain, distress or personal care attended to.

* Dirt and mess, left in waste, blood, vomit,  for hours after asking for clean linen and help to change night clothes. dirty bedpans under bed allong with catheter bags.

* Very conserned about meals, and the lack of them. veggie meal never came the whole 10 weeks i was a patient. staff joked about it when a meat dish would arive after complaints were sent numurous times to the catering department.
one bannana and an apple deliverd by a dietitian is not enough to live on, or try and get someone stronger.

* noise at night, laughing and on moile phones at night,and eatting most of the time were the night staff. 

* when going for tests, was left in a drafty corridore for an hour and a half before then having to go ack to the ward because was too ill.

Waiting times and wrong information on seeing a doctor. waiting days!

* was given an overdose of medication due to negligence. resulting in a bad reaction. this is still under investigation.

8806,"I am a health advocate working for a charity in Islington for people with learning difficulties. I spend a lot of my professional life in various hospitals, supporting clients to access services and I experience a very wide variety in the quality of delivery. With this in mind I would like to say how brilliant the senior orthopaedic technician at the Royal Free Hospital, has been on the two occasions that I have been fortunate enough to visit with a client.

With anyone, but especially with our client group, it is important to be clear and transparent when dealing with people’s health. The orthopaedic technician has always been very talkative, friendly and open. They treat those who come into the room as equals and not as receivers of services. The orthopaedic technician has done more than the minimum required and gone out of their way to be helpful and to make sure that my client received the very best care.

On top of this, and of equal importance, is that the orthopaedic technician is excellent at what they do as an orthopaedic technician. The casts they make are obviously of a very high quality and they make them with the skill of someone who loves what they do and that they are good at it. I cannot commend them highly enough in every aspect of the work that I have witnessed. I feel very strongly that people like this must be recognised for their good practice, just as complaints should be made and followed up.",Royal Free Hospital,positive

The SHO was incredible, really took time to sit with me and talk things through, and made appropriate referrals.  all the midwives were lovely, and didn't make me feel like I was wasting their time.  The consultant and midwives at the ante-natal clinic were also amazing, and came up with a planned extension to my stay in hospital and medication post-natally.

I had a horrendous experience having my first child at another Manchester hospital, and Trafford was the antithesis of this.  They definitely make you feel like an individual.

1522,"The doctor and their team were absolutely wonderful and did everything they could for me.  They instantly gave me relief for a short while from my severe trigeminal neuralgia and also arranged to get me admitted to my local hospital to deal with my renal issues besides arranging cover there which could help keep my tn at a comfortable situation to allow the other acute issue to be sorted.  They stayed behind with me whilst they got everything sorted and in place for me, and then the doctor later phoned the hospital where I had been admitted to, to ensure I had arrived safely.

I really am very greatful to them all and cannot thank them enough

On my previous visits to the Charles Clifford I have always had excellent service from the doctor and their team,  always finding the facilities spotless, and the staff excellent in both listening to what I have said and also in their advice.

I have not yet become a patient as I am STILL waiting for an appointment with the Neurology Dept. I have been waiting since Oct 2009. When I rang to find out why I hadnt had an appointment, it turns out that they had been sending my appointments to the wrong address - an address with is over 16 miles away from where I live that I have never heard of. I asked them to let me know what I had missed through not reciving any mail and it turns out out I had 4 appoinments made for me and all had been cancelled and rescheduled, so even if I had recieved the appoinment letters, all the appointments had still been cancelled. 
The secretary at Neurology was very unhelpful and kept telling me to see what came in the post. I went through to the PALS service who confirmed the problem and found a new appointment for me - which has yet again been cancelled!!!! 
Also I have been given conflicting information about where my appointments will be - I have been told by 1 person that my appoinment wil be at Birch Hill ""as they dont deal with Neurology at Rochdale"" and told by another person that I will be seen at Rochdale ""as they dont deal with Neurology at Birch Hill"".

Is it not beyond any organisational capability to be able to fit in a simple procedure (three strips and a dab of glue) between standing around? Also, why couldn't the doctor have simply carried this out when he diagnosed?
If people are fighting to keep this service, they must be misguided, the people who manage this facility need to look very carefully at its efficiency and operation. Having sampled Mansfield as well, they can't transfer this service quickly enough.

Large boards at the car park entrance could not be read in time to find out what it said. I couldn't park in a designated Disabled space as there were none left so parked in an ordinary space. On trying to get an exit ticket from the booth I was told that I couldn't have one as I hadn't parked in a disabled space even though there weren't any !! I was offered the rule book to read. Had I lied I would have been able to get an exit ticket as the car park attendant wouldn't have known any different but I don't usually lie. (I might in future though). There are only 4 disabled spaces in front of East Block so I was told if they were full I should have gone to College Road car park where they have 12 spaces. Point 1. I would have had to pay to get out of that car park on finding no disabled spaces in order to drive around to College Road. Point 2. The whole point of my having a disabled blue badge is so I can walk to places I need without pain. I can't walk from College Road to East Block, that's why I have the badge. Your car park attendant was very unprofessional, very uncaring and totally didn't understand my point of view when the logic of it is obvious .

As a Lewes resident I was taken to the minor injuries unit about 17:30 only to find it was closed due to staff illness. I was feeling very unwell and simply stood there trying to decide what to do when a staff member (possibly a cleaner) saw me, and asked if I was in pain. I explained, they asked me to sit down and went on the wards to find nursing staff. A Theatre nurse came, quickly assessed me and organised oxygen for me. One of their colleagues monitored my other responses and between them I was stabilised enough to get to Haywards Heath A&E where I was successfully treated that evening. 
I am most grateful to the staff for this emergency care, and particularly for the person I met first. They may not have had formal medical training, and it is probably too dramatic to say that their response saved my life, but it could not have been more helpful.

I picked Walsall as the waiting time for an appointment was very short compared to other local hospitals, even though it was not the closest place I could have been treated.
After spending ages trying to park the car in what can only be described as a nightmare- the OPD was even worse.
 When I arrived there were lots of people waiting to see this consultant even though I was just in advance of my appointment time. I asked the recepionist if he was running to time where she smiled and said he always runs late! 
After waiting for 45 minutes another member of the public came out of another waiitng area and said to her friend she still had not been seen ONE AND HALF HOURS after her appointmentime. When at this point another elderly gent got up and said he could beat that as he'd been waiting since 1410. It was now 1615hours!!.
At this point I got up and decided I was not waiting another 2 hours to see a consultant and informed the recepionist of this.
The fact that a consultant can keep patients waiting for this long is totally unacceptable - is my time any less precious than his? No -
 I took annual leave to go to the appointment, travelled some distance and paid for car parking  and had a completely wasted journey.
I will not be returning to Walsall Out patients dept. 
What could have been improved ? Everything- the wait area , the car parking, the space in a 'corridor ' to be designated as a clinic and finally the fact that ambulance staff were bringing very ill patients on stretchers through an already busy place who deserved more diginity than to be paraded through a busy corridor full of people waiitng for appointments.",Manor Hospital,negative

This wasn't a problem until 75 minutes of waiting.  I spoke to the receptionist and she went off to investigate the lengthy delay.  I over heard her whispering 'we're going to have to tell her something'.  Rather odd, I thought, why can't they just tell me the truth.

Another lady came to see me and said that I should have been sent home.  This was an outright lie.  Firstly, why would I have an appointment to see a consultant and then only see a 'booking in' person and repeat what I'd told my GP. Secondly, why did every other woman waiting go in after 10 minutes and then return to the waiting room before being called to the consultant apart from me.  Also, I was clearly told to wait for a few minutes and the person I saw actually walked me back to the waiting room.

They 'kindly' let me see the consultant anyway, who told me (not asked me) that I needed a small op.  I've refused as they didn't discuss it with me properly, were highly dismissive and  after my previous experience with the hospital (about 4 years ago), I know they're likely to do the operation wrong.   

For those interested, last time was concerning the birth of my first born.  I was two weeks late and induced for 72 hours only to discover my baby was breach.  This was all down to being misdiagnosed by two drs and half a dozen midwives.  At one point they had gone to get a scanning machine, but as it was broken they decided that my baby was certainly engaged and continued to inflict unnecessary pain on me.  I can honestly say that they acted like they couldn't be 'bothered' to try and find another scanning machine.

I am writing to tell you how I feel about a member of you’re A&E staff who dealt with my husband, around 4.am today until 6.am.
This lady I have to say is one of thee most wonderful “earth Angels” I and my daughter have ever met.  She was, and is incredible and showed my husband such caring compassion beyond anything I have ever known.
She gave my husband a bed bath as he was in a mess, and also gave him his enoaxaparin injection I had taken along with me, in case he was admitted. All this, along  with a warm comforting attitude. 
Accident and Emergency are normally manned by very efficient nice caring people [with the exception of one or two]. But for you’re A&E to have a lady like this on your staff is indeed a blessing for your future patients.
This lady is and always will be my “Earth Angel”.
Please inform her of this email if you would be so kind.

My husband is slowly slipping away from me, and he called her his treasure. In the couple of hours we had  met her, my  opinion of the NHS has indeed changed.

Gods Blessings to her and all of you there. xx

It was comforting to see everyone making checks to ensure I was the purpose I was purporting to be to ensure I received the right procedure.  Back on the ward, nurses continuously monitored me.

All the team seemed to be geared up to the patient and what should happen at a given time.  If the patient looked uncomfortable they were immediately by their side.

A brilliant ward to be on, thanks to ALL the staff.",Chorley and South Ribble Hospital,positive

Dear Madam/Sir: 

We want to say THANK YOU to both the 999 Emergency Service and Ambulance Service for the high level of professional services offered to us on Saturday, May 1 at about 1.05 pm. We contacted 999 at the instructions of the out-of-hour Frimley Primary Care services by texting to emergencySMS, a trial service provided for Deaf and hard of hearing people. An ambulance responded and arrived within five minutes.

We regret that we did not capture names and titles, but checking your records will reveal the ""first responders"" on that call. Our then seven-month-old son had a great difficulty with breathing, but was ambulatory by the time the Hampshire's finest arrived. The crew took him in and immediately communicated reassuring words, yet handled him in a serious, professional and caring manner; we will long remember the smiles and the brief explanations of what they were doing at each step.

The attending technician took the mother while our son was taken and handed over to the A&E staff at Frimley Park Hospital. The father stayed behind at home with our two-year-old daughter.

Furthermore, we want to say THANK YOU to the A&E team at Frimley Park Hospital for their assistance with our son. They are meticulous to their professional job of saving lives. When the team realised that the mother is Deaf, they got very patient and attentive. This is something that we do not see in everyday lives.

We also want to say THANK YOU to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Southampton General Hospital to where our son was transferred during the evening of the same date. We could not express in words how amazing and dedicated the staff members were. They are one in a million. It was simply a horrific experience for us to see our son in tubes and needles and to witness other babies in need. Because of the kindness and assurance portrayed by the members, we felt safe th",Frimley Park Hospital,positive

8753,"I was a patient on 5 East B ward last week while I had an operation. I spent lots of time in hospital as a child at Great Ormand Street and always received fantastic care. This was my first experience of being an inpatient at an adult hospital and I was slightly nervous. However I was really impressed by the care and treatment I received!

I found my surgeon very approachable and think the surgeon did a fantastic job- I was very impressed by how small my scars are! All the nurses gave me exceptional care and are obviously very well trained-  I couldn't have asked for better-thank you for taking such great care of me and helping me make a such a quick and stress-free recovery! Also the anaesthetist was great and again very approachable.

I found the general atmosphere on the ward very friendly and relaxing. All staff-including the health care assistants and cleaners were friendly, available and always made sure I was okay. If I pressed my buzzer someone would come quickly and never made me feel like a burden. Even the porter who took me down to surgery was lovely and made me feel at ease at a pretty nerve wracking time. All areas of the hospital I saw were clean and the food was fine. Overall I had a very positive experience at the Royal Free and would like to thank the surgeon and the team on 5 East B ward for such fantastic care.",Royal Free Hospital,positive
