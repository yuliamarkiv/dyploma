0,"I had an appointment at the Endoscopy Unit on 11th April and experienced excellent care from start to finish of the time I spent there.
The four members of the team who carried out the procedure were faultless in every way. Truly I couldn't have had a better team of medical professionals.  The screening practitioner explained everything, was understanding and reassuring, communicated well throughout the procedure, and the three nurses present were empathic and caring also. 
The way they all balanced patient care and professionalism was impressive and I'm grateful to them individually and as a team. 
The unit is comfortable and clean and the before and after procedure care was also excellent. 
A heartfelt thank you. ",RA901,Don't know,April,2024,positive

3,My wife took my 13 year old daughter to Dorchester Hospital A&E on 27/3/24 after my daughter had injured her hand.  The staff were very efficient and helpful and the hand was x-rayed and doctors reviewed the x-ray then.  The waiting time was not long. The next day my wife was telephoned to advise of the x-ray results and advice on what happened next was given.  The service from dialling 111 to assessment was very quick and professional and my wife and I are very grateful for this.  The NHS is a very important service for UK residents and this experience reinforces how lucky we are to have it.

Seen by very rude nurse practitioner, belittled me for bringing my daughter in with 'just a cough' and told me I shouldn't be there.  
This is against NICE and NHS guidance, steroids should be given based on description of the symptoms due to croup causing symptoms predominantly at night. 
She should have at the very least given information on what symptoms to watch out for and when to seek medical attention, she has a duty if care to do this as a nurse. Very worrying and disappointing behaviour ",RH5G5,Urgent care centre,March,2024,negative

I felt nauseated, lost my balance while standing, and decided to take a taxi instead. I got to e&e. The doctor advised me to take medication after comparing my symptoms to those from years ago(how come, symptoms persist the same all life, nothing change, don't we get older ? where is profesionality/expertise?). That's it. I was so sick that I could hardly stand on my legs, and this is an e&e excellent practice with talk in news and newspaper ,how NHS save lifes(sorry not everyone)? You saved resources and money in my case, good but you can apply it a a private sector company, not in heath care. If you claim that you provide excellent practice and services then why I did not get it?! Now, in order to check the blood sugar level, if you present to an emergency room with symptoms similar to mine, they must take your blood. Since this will inform you of what comes next. Additionally, an ECG must be performed if you present with symptoms similar to mine. These two actions are fundamental standard protocols that should always be followed in case of emergency. I speak for myself; I don't visit the emergency room to talk, smile, or inquire about a title. They have an obligation to attend. Physicians pledged to save lives.

26,"I was sent to the surgical assessment unit by my Doctors' surgery Practice Nurse. I had a dangerously distended abdomen which needed urgent attention. I was seen to in what l believe was a reasonable time with great care and understanding before l was moved to a surgical ward  (Stowupland) as an in-patient for some tests and procedures over several days. It was decided that l should really be in the Gastronomy (Stradbroke) ward which took a few more days through a shortage of beds l believe. This period was the most frustrating as l was left in a kind  of ""limbo"" without much information as to my future treatment. After l was eventually transferred things moved at a good pace. Procedures were done, every day an attentive doctor and/or a consultant or specialist came to see me to spend time to explain each step and plan for my treatment. I was dealt with by several departments. CT scans, colonoscopy, radiology and imaging. All of the staff and professionals involved with me treated me with great sympathy, understanding and respect at all times. It was my very first time in any hospital and l was truly impressed by the care and attention l saw, not only for me but for all of my fellow patients...yes even the grumpy ones! Thanks to all who knew of me during the four-and-a-half weeks l was there, and thanks for your help during a most difficult  time. I think l made a few people cheerful as they did me.

27,"My Grandson was born with talipes to one foot and the foot was quite badly twisted.  He has visited the Orthopaedic Dept at Stoke every Thursday for the past 7 weeks and his foot is now perfectly in place and at the correct angle.  The Consultant and nurses have been absolutely fantastic and have supported my daughter and son-in-law through the process.  For new parents, this could have been all very upsetting but the way they have been treated has made the experience a positive one.  It could have been very different.  
My Grandson has just been fitted with his little boots (he looks like he's going ski boarding!) but, at only 10 weeks old, he's well on the way to 2 perfect feet.  
There is so much negativity towards the NHS but we are so thankful that my Grandson's treatment started when he was 2 weeks old and it was such a positive experience.

58,"I visited the hospital for the first time today. I rang a couple of days ago to check arrangements for disabled parking & was told there were designated places & it was free to park. There are only 4 or 5 places, I parked in one of a block of 2. These were at the far side of the car park, this being the longest distance to the main entry doors. On returning to my car I prepared to leave, expecting to find instructions on how to get out. I parked near to the pay machine (I can't walk very far). There were no instructions at the pay point as to how to get out of the car park, another lady was there in a similar position to me. We both decided to just pay in the normal way, she managed to do this however it wouldn't take either of my cards. A man pulled up next to us to ask if he could help, we told him the problem. He also had a blue badge & told us he had gone through the same rigmarole. He had gone back inside the hospital to ask for help, he told us you have to take your ticket to someone to remove the charge. I walked back & was given a new 'free' ticket. The system is fine but why aren't the instructions clearly displayed? I find walking very painful & yet, as a disabled person I had to walk 2 or 3 times further than able bodied people to find out how to get out. I wouldn't have minded paying, I just needed easier access to my car due to my disability. Instead I had to walk much further causing me pain which will take 2 or 3 days to subside. I got out in the end but please, somebody put some instructions up - at both pay points & at strategic areas in the hospital. In future I'll park in a normal spot close to the entry doors & just pay.

60,"I lost my right leg 20 years ago to vascular disease. Last October I was advised that my left leg would require an above knee amputation and that my pain level will decide when it would proceed. I was told I would have a review approximately every 4 months. As you can imagine I am quite keen to not miss these appointments. Today I received a letter admonishing me for not attending an appointment on 22nd February 2023, an appointment I didn't know I had!  
The last time I was at the clinic I was told I would receive a letter initially and then a reminder closer to the date. I didn't get a letter or any reminder (the NHS has 5 ways to contact me, phone, post, email, text and the NHS app).  
My GP has a copy of the non attendance letter and I'm left feeling that I've done something wrong and I feel guilty because the vascular teams at Bournemouth Hospital and Poole Hospital have been so good to me over the years.  
In my opinion the biggest failure here is the NHS app. In this digital age people use these as a primary contact point and they really need to be up to the task.  
Anyway that's me.",R0D01,,December,2022,positive

I eventually saw them around six hours later. They gave me a painkiller discharged me telling me that they would send the prescription to the GP and I would be seeing a spinal surgeon. That was a number of days ago.  
My GP hasn't received the prescription and the discharge letter and when I've tried to call the department the contact centre hasn't heard of the dept. So I still have no use of my arm and no painkillers and I'll be damned if I go back.",RRK15,,December,2022,negative

Literally no doctors available, being pushed from one room to another being fobbed off by giving stupid reasons for waiting and asked to wait another 2 hours in a room with no chairs to sit on. Some staff (not all) are rude, patronising and treat their patients with contempt. Others are apologetic and try their best to do their job in a broken churn of people who need to see a doctor. When will someone finally say the nhs is not fit for purpose? That time has surely come. The United Kingdom is now worse than a Third world country and has a nhs pushed beyond breaking point.

86,"I was accompanying my elderly father-in-law to an ophthalmology appointment relating to his ongoing Giant Cell Arteritis. He is notoriously poor as a historian, at remembering medical details and even answering basic yet sometimes important questions accurately. As such he is always extremely reassured when I accompany him to his many hospital appointments, even to the extent of rearranging them if I am not available. He always wants me to be with him even for the most minor of consultations. I think my 40 year nursing career, mostly critical care - much as a senior nurse/manager - gives him a great sense of reassurance.  
Prior to him being seen by the ophthalmologist he was given a sight test. I was asked to wait outside so I explained he would prefer me to be present. I was admitted but throughout the test there was a low, but very badly disguised, level of hostility to my presence.  
Having been a health care practitioner for so long myself, I can understand that it can sometimes be annoying to be challenged, even politely, and my request may have seemed unnecessary, but I do not think this warrants making me feel extremely uncomfortable. I was acting not to interfere or get in the way, but because it was what the patient wanted, and also to ensure that any questions relating to his long and complex history had the correct interpretation and response.  
Both of these motives were in the interest of enhancing his care, something everyone is surely behind. I understand this is relatively unimportant in the scheme of things, but the small things are really important and cost nothing in time or resources. I do wonder: had I been wearing a Critical Care Manager badge, would I have been made to feel the same way?  
I have to add this has been an isolated incident and generally the staff at SHH have been very accommodating to my father-in-law’s needs",RWJ09,,October,2022,positive
87,"We booked an appointment through 111 and we were assured that a Doctor is going to see my partner between 3 and 4 am at the emergency unit. I was driving 30 minutes just to get there in the middle of the night from a different city. When we arrived we were asked to fill in a form because the receptionist claimed the book by appointment button does not work on their iPad app, which in hindsight was suspicious.
Then came the surprise as we were told that  we need to wait an additional 7 hours to be seen, which is exactly what we wanted to avoid otherwise neither my partner nor me could not even go to work the next day. The receptionist had the nerve to say that both of us misunderstood what what 111 said, when we confirmed 5 times with 111 that a doctor is going to check my partner between 3 am and 4 am. Then the receptionist even started moralising if we not read the news, that 7 hours is the wait time in every hospital. Checked,

88,"We arrive at the hospital at 8:10pm, there was no reception staff to manage the entrance, so we queued to go to urgent care services, only after 45mins of queuing, suddenly a nurse and security appeared and asked all people in the queue to move back to reception to register to be seen. As this caused chaos, people lost their place to be seen, as other people pushed in. This made our wait in a&e longer. I was there with my 5 year old child who was the patient. The staff at reception and security had no idea what they were doing. Why was the desk to receive people into urgent care left unattended for 45mins to only cause extra delays!

Some needs to ensure that staff are scheduled properly to cover breaks too.

When I spoke to a nurse he was aggressive in his tone and incapable of addressing my concerns. The doctor left before the time I was told he was leaving so I was unable to meet him there for unable to get an update on the patient.  In addition the head nurse was very dismissive and unwilling to help when I went to speak to her, she huffed and puffed when I asked a question about the patients medication. The staff are also unable to confirm what medication was given to the patient at a specific time and are unwilling to listen to our concerns. Overall, I’ve had a very bad experience with the team, they have poor communication and are unwilling to help when clearly family members are distressed and need reassurance that the patient is being taken care of to a good standard.
