One nurse was particularly rude on a few occasions. During my four day stay I only needed to call for assistance once on the evening about 21:00 hrs, after my surgery as I felt extremely unwell. My room was next to the nurses station so I could hear them talking about a quiz they were doing but the bell was not answered and it rang for quite a while before I had to resort to calling out in the end and still no one came. I think they must have decided to come after I stopped calling as I came round from blacking out to find my room full of nurses and a doctor", "dateSubmitted": "2023-11-30T07:12:24Z", "lastUpdated": "2024-02-17T06:54:38Z", "sentimentScore": 0.0, "department": "Orthopaedics", "publisherID": "0", "publishersCommentRef": "1709732", "screenName": "Anonymous", "status": "Published With Edits", "removeReportLink": false, "ratings": [{"question": "10015", "rating": 2.0}, {"question": "10012", "rating": 0.0}, {"question": "10017", "rating": 0.0}, {"question": "10013", "rating": 0.0}, {"question": "10014", "rating": 0.0}, {"question": "10016", "rating": 0.0}], "visit": {"month": 11, "year": 2022}}, "response": null}, {"comment": {"commentId": "01d3bc1c-3ecc-ee11-9078-00224840d396", "commentRef": "1762247", "responseID": "", "odsCode": "RWH01", "commentOriginalURL": "", "title": "Great care", "commentText": "Thank you to the walk-in Urgent Treatment Centre and Radiography departments. 90 minutes from arrival to departure with broken wrist x-rayed and treated in between. 30 minutes after arriving home I got a call from Orthopedics for my follow up appointment the next week.

Whilst there appear to be mirrors in the Consultants' rooms there are none in the toilets used by patients or staff. Hence patients are unable to check their appearance before meeting a Consultant, and nurses and other staff cannot do the same prior to meeting potential and existing clients. Does \"the management\" believe that only women like to ensure that the wind outside has not blown their hair into a mess and if so do they dislike women (like me) so much that they have had all the mirrors (that we have always relied upon) removed? Aren't mirrors usually standard in W/Cs?

I explained how frustrated I was that I could not get through on the number on the letter and she could not give me an explanation as to what the problem was. Since then I received another letter rescheduling the appointment for February 7th ( pre op ) and February 12th for procedure. On Thursday the 1st of February I rang to cancel the procedure and be taken off the waiting list as I need to treat my dry eye problem and receive my laser correction records which will probably take several months. The person I spoke to said that they would do that. Despite this I have had several messages left on my home phone confirming the two appointments. I tried ringing today and had the same problem getting someone to answer the phone. No doubt this will go down as my not attending for the appointments which is not the case.

I work as a receptionist for the NHS and I would never speak to someone in this manor. My son also bled a lot and I said I was aware head injuries bleed a lot but due to the nursery workers all advising he gets medical attention that's what im doing, she looked at his head and went \"its just a scratch\", which considering the amount of blood his school clothes were soaked with and the hole he ended up having to get glued was just another unnecessary comment that felt so patronising.

There was 2 nurses stood in the middle of my mum room talking when the ward clerk came in and said I have found the chair it was in another wards staff room the staff had been using it, that chair is for the patients it reclined.  Still not thinking anything of it till someone came into the ward pushing this reclining chair that had been at the side of my mums bed, so in other words the staff had taken this recliner from my mum replaced it with a normal chair and took the recliner to the staff room for themselves. Got to say this is disgusting my daughter and I couldn\u2019t believe it, I mean I didn\u2019t get time to relax in a recliner when I worked, and I thought nurses are over worked don\u2019t think so if got time to change chairs.

The staff were helpful, clear in communication and made me feel at ease and well cared for.  \r\nWithin 72 hours of being discharged I had been contacted by the fracture clinic and appointment booked for the same week. I arrived at fracture clinic to be greeted by friendly staff, sent for X-ray and reviewed and spoken to a consultant. My whole clinic appointment including X-rays was 1hr and 10 minutes. I left with a plan for emergency surgery and was informed I would be called in 24-48 hours.  \r\nI received a call that evening to discuss my surgery, asked to remain NBM from midnight and informed I would be contacted between 8-9am the following morning if surgery was likely that day. I was called the following morning at 830am as promised where I attended the day surgery department for ORIF of the ankle.  \r\nThe staff were very friendly sharing gentle humour to alleviate any stresses. They made sure myself and my partner were comfortable and well informed throughout. Post Op I was swiftly moved from recovery back to day surgery where the staff were also extremely kind and helpful. I remained for a short time, my take away medications were waiting for me prior to my arrival and I was escorted to the car when I felt ready.  \r\nI received a call the following day to book my 2 week review of care which is where I currently am at on my recovery journey. I have received nothing but outstanding care. The processes and procedures in place work like a well oiled machine and I am extremely grateful to all staff I have encountered on my journey so far.  \r\nBoth my partner and I are NHS staff at a London trust and couldn\u2019t be more impressed with the care received at both Stoke Mandeville and Wycombe hospitals.

Put me at ease immediately, carried out the procedure professionally, explaining exactly what he was going to do and was doing throughout. Very interesting conversation also, taking my mind off the procedure being performed. Would happily visit again and insist if i could on the same Doctor. Thank you sir.

All of our previous appointments for baby related things had also been at this hospital.\r\n\r\nAll I can say is wow. We had such a lovely experience throughout the pregnancy and the staff were amazing, especially during the induction process and the labour. This is compounded by the fact we have relatives going through the same process a couple weeks behind us at a different hospital and hearing how bad their experience has been it really had highlight how amazing Leighton is and the staff on the maternity ward. I only wish I could publish names of the staff we had dealings with to thank them on a more personal level too.
