Every member of staff was pleasant and polite even when faced with challenging & changing situations treating everybody with the care they needed. The ward was keep clean and tidy by more amazing staff who took the time to remember what certain patients liked to eat and would happily make it for them if they didn't want what was on offer. I am so glad my treatment was here even though I am not from the area as I don't think I could have gone anywhere better or been treated any better by all involved. All the staff there will always have my deepest respect and admiration for being so brilliant in such tough situations.

These were at the far side of the car park, this being the longest distance to the main entry doors. On returning to my car I prepared to leave, expecting to find instructions on how to get out. I parked near to the pay machine (I can't walk very far). There were no instructions at the pay point as to how to get out of the car park, another lady was there in a similar position to me. We both decided to just pay in the normal way, she managed to do this however it wouldn't take either of my cards. A man pulled up next to us to ask if he could help, we told him the problem. He also had a blue badge & told us he had gone through the same rigmarole. He had gone back inside the hospital to ask for help, he told us you have to take your ticket to someone to remove the charge. I walked back & was given a new 'free' ticket. The system is fine but why aren't the instructions clearly displayed? I find walking very painful & yet, as a disabled person I had to walk 2 or 3 times further than able bodied people to find out how to get out. I wouldn't have minded paying, I just needed easier access to my car due to my disability. Instead I had to walk much further causing me pain which will take 2 or 3 days to subside. I got out in the end but please, somebody put some instructions up - at both pay points & at strategic areas in the hospital. In future I'll park in a normal spot close to the entry doors & just pay.

He is notoriously poor as a historian, at remembering medical details and even answering basic yet sometimes important questions accurately. As such he is always extremely reassured when I accompany him to his many hospital appointments, even to the extent of rearranging them if I am not available. He always wants me to be with him even for the most minor of consultations. I think my 40 year nursing career, mostly critical care - much as a senior nurse/manager - gives him a great sense of reassurance.  \nPrior to him being seen by the ophthalmologist he was given a sight test. I was asked to wait outside so I explained he would prefer me to be present. I was admitted but throughout the test there was a low, but very badly disguised, level of hostility to my presence.  \nHaving been a health care practitioner for so long myself, I can understand that it can sometimes be annoying to be challenged, even politely, and my request may have seemed unnecessary, but I do not think this warrants making me feel extremely uncomfortable. I was acting not to interfere or get in the way, but because it was what the patient wanted, and also to ensure that any questions relating to his long and complex history had the correct interpretation and response.  \nBoth of these motives were in the interest of enhancing his care, something everyone is surely behind. I understand this is relatively unimportant in the scheme of things, but the small things are really important and cost nothing in time or resources.
